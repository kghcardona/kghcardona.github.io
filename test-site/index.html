    <p>My name is Keily and welcome to my personal website! I am originally from Ponce, Puerto Rico,
       and I am currently in Boston for university. I am a third year Data Science major at Northeastern University.
       I love data in all forms. It can be from conducting an exploratory analysis on an already formed dataset to solving a
       jigsaw puzzle while interpreting every piece as a portion of data. Outside of career-related activities, I am 
       a big reader, specifically the romance, fantasy, and mystery/thriller books. My goal with the website is to ultimately build my personal brand and showcase what I love to do.  
       In this website, I intend to include
